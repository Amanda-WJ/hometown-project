                Being so close to the Peak District means New Mills is a popular destination for outdoor sports. Kinder Scout is just a short distance away in Hayfield and is one of the most popular destinations for hikers in the area. Some spectacular views of Kinder can be seen from many of the hills and viewpoints around New Mills, examples of which can be seen at the top and bottom of this page.
